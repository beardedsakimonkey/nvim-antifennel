# nvim-antifennel

This is a neovim plugin that provides an `:Antifennel` command that runs the current selection (or
the entire file if not in visual mode) through
[antifennel](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/antifennel) and replaces the selection with the output.

This plugin vendors in `antifennel` for convenience (currently
[ebd11ba5](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/antifennel/commit/ebd11ba545f6e1a08519004822b2349dbc82a8ad)).
