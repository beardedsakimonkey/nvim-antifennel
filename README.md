# nvim-antifennel

This is a neovim plugin that provides an `:Antifennel` command that runs the current selection (or
the entire file if not in visual mode) through
[antifennel](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/antifennel) and replaces the selection with the output.

This plugin vendors in `antifennel` for convenience (currently
[a9d3c5ec](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/antifennel/commit/a9d3c5ec5de8f2ce5b77e320bbe4c98d9b8d2832)).

This plugin is released under the MIT/X license, just like `antifennel`.
